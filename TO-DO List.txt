--- WOLFPUNCHER ---
to-do list:

--technical--
disable object spawning while game is paused
the LevelPlacer script currently acts as a dual script for two different objects
	Should probably pull this script apart and make two separate scripts, one for the 
	worldContainer and one for the actual platforms. Just make it eaiser to understand,
	it works just fine the way it is.
design levels in a way that when the next level is spawned and the player is on it, no other level 
	is active/interferes with the curLevel
Add Boss Fights
	-mayor dodging left and right
	-mayor stationary
	-Designed like Punch-Out!
	-Boss Patterns
	-etc
Add remaining Obstacles to the game along with their spawners
Create Displays to show Mayor's Jumpforce and PunchForce to the player
Reintroduce the Score as the number of wolves destroyed by the Mayor's Fist
Display a game Timer
Have the Mayor Mood Indicator animate properly (again)
Implement the use of external files to load dialogue for the Dialogue.cs file to use.
Write the dialogue for each event in game
Implement each in game event
Add Remaining Actors to the game
Implement Actor's switching Sprites when appropriate during "Cutscenes"
Display the Speaking Actor's name in the appropriate text box during "Cutscenes"
Need to close the Dialogue "Cutscene"

--visual--
proper background sprites
proper animation for the mayor's punches
proper anim for the mayor
proper sprites for the ground
proper sprites for the obstacles
,,, Basically all the art needs to be done, 
	game sprites, character portraits, objects and their animations, etc
	

If you decide to start working on someting from the list:
Inform the team of what item you'll be working on
Create a back up of any prefabs or scripts you'll be working in
Create a new scene (duplicate the LevelTesting scene) to work in.
Once your changes are done Inform the rest of the team so we can implement 
your changes to the main scene and all sync together.
